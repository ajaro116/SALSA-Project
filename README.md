Overview: What algorithms were implemented?
    The algorithms implemented were First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling. FCFS schedules the first process that arrives to run and SJF schedules the jobs with the shortest burst time to run first. These algorithms demonstrate key scheduling concepts such as waiting time (WT), turn-around time (TAT), and CPU utilization.

Implementation Details: How did you handle process scheduling?

Results: Show sample runs and performance comparison (e.g., FCFS vs. RR).

Challenges & Solutions: What difficulties did you face?
